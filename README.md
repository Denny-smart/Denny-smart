## 🌟 About Me

I'm a Software developer and virtual assistant who creates practical tech solutions. I specialize in Python, Django, Node.js, React, TypeScript, and databases to build systems that are both technically solid and genuinely helpful for users.

I started my career training AI for software engineering projects. The detailed work taught me precision and showed me how AI solves real-world problems. This experience sparked my passion for creating practical tech solutions.

I also provide virtual assistant support that helps businesses stay organized and reach more people.
